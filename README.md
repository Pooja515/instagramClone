# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Instagram Clone: Creating Social Media Platform
Welcome to the Instagram Clone project! Instagram, a widely used social media platform, has captured the hearts of millions with its visual appeal and 
user-friendly interface. 

Project Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to create an Instagram clone using an array of technologies including React, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Thunk, Spring Boot, and MySQL. 

Technologies Explored :

React: A JavaScript library for crafting interactive user interfaces.
Chakra UI: A modular and accessible component library for React applications.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs swiftly.
Redux: A state container offering predictable state management for JavaScript apps.
Thunk: A middleware for Redux, facilitating asynchronous logic in tandem with the Redux store.
Spring Boot: An open-source Java framework for constructing microservices and applications.
MySQL: A free and open-source relational database management system.

Getting Started
To begin your journey of creating an Instagram clone, follow the steps outlined in this repository. This equips you with the knowledge and skills to bring your social media dreams to life. This project offers hands-on experience in building a feature-rich application.

Building Modal Form and Search Components
The Instagram clone by creating a modal form for creating new posts. Additionally, implement search components to allow users to search by name, email, and username. This adds an interactive and dynamic touch to the application, enhancing user experience.

Setting Up the Front-end
To kick off the front-end development, start by creating a new React app using the create-react-app command. Then, enrich your app with the necessary dependencies by adding the following to your package.

json:

"@chakra-ui/react": "^1.6.7",
"@emotion/react": "^11.4.0",
"@emotion/styled": "^11.3.0",
"@reduxjs/toolkit": "^1.6.2",
"axios": "^0.24.0",
"react-redux": "^7.2.6",
"redux-thunk": "^2.4.1",
"tailwindcss": "^3.0.5"
